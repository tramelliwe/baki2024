# Research Project Code Repository

This repository contains scripts and analyses developed for clinical research, focusing specifically on biomarkers, patient stratification, and follow-up analyses in critical care settings.

## Detailed File Summaries:


- **SQL_v3.R**: Manages database connectivity and data handling tasks. Utilizes MySQL databases and includes extensive data cleaning, transformation, and statistical preprocessing.

- **corrplot2.R**: A custom correlation plotting function that calculates and visually represents significant correlations among variables, tailored for clinical research data.

- **kml3d_v2.R**: Synchronizes cytokine trajectory data around peak activities and performs clustering analyses to understand cytokine dynamics in patient groups visually and statistically.

- **main.Rmd**: Central R Markdown notebook containing primary analysis pipelines, including setup, data manipulation, statistical tests, and visualizations.

- **targeted_interventions.R**: Identifies subgroups of patients using cytokine and oxidative stress biomarkers. It stratifies patient risk groups to facilitate targeted clinical interventions.

### Usage:
Each script requires specific R packages and formatted clinical datasets as detailed within individual scripts. Follow the inline comments and instructions for correct implementation.
